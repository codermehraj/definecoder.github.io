# Set

## Introduction
Set is a container which has very special for its functionality. This have some variants which are also discussed here later on.  The main features of default set is :
- It stores each element once and don't allow repeated elements. Which means default set stores only distinct elements.
- It keeps elements in sorted order. You can customize how the elements will be sorted. But By default it keeps the elements in ascending order. 
- You can use other variants of the set like multiset, unordered_set, unordered_multiset as you need.

## Declaration:
First of all you need to add the header file of set to use any functionality of set. To do that you have to add the following header :
```cpp
#include <set>
```
After adding the header you can declare your set using this code:
```cpp
set < data_type > MySet;
```
